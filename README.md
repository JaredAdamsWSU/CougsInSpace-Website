# CougsInSpace-Website
This website was built using components of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Some third party tools and wrappers used include SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap, Flask, and Postman for testing the server. This website was built full-stack from scratch. I plan to use this website and it's framework as a template to implement the distributable ground communications software for the CougSat1 cube satellite during the Spring 2018 semester.

In order to run and view this website in it's full functionality you will need to have at least Python Ver. 3.6.0 installed.

You can fire up the server by navigating to the directory containing the app.py file and running the command "python app.py"

Once the server is up and running on http://localhost:5000 you will be able to query the database and send or receive requests you make while having the webpage open in the browser.

Thanks!
